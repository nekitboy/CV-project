# How to run
All code is stored in `.ipynb` files with stored output which could be run via `jupyter notebook` or colab

## First part (the best part)
`image_dog_finder.ipynb` - Pretrained Yolo with pretrained classification model


## Second part
##### Attempt to train our own YOLO model
`create_yolo_dataset.ipynb` - Form dataset to train YOLO. 

`Training_Yolo_for_breed_detection.ipynb` - code of how we train YOLO model and save it.

`Testing_of_Yolo_breed_identification.ipynb` - code of loading trained YOLO model and test
